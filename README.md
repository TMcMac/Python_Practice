## Python Practice! 

So in pursuit of knowledge, skill, and good times with Python I'll be going through a series of projects that will live in this repository.
Not everything will be completely built out but this is more about learning and practice than finish projects.
I'll try to keep a record of each project file, it's description or purpose, and it's state of completeness here in the readme.

1. TwitBotV0.2 - A basic twitter bot built for @accelerateai to like tweets that contain specific hashtags, as well as from specific accounts.
   The bot itself is functional so long as you have developer keys in a file called keys.txt in the same directory as the twitbot file. Currently this
   needs additional testing and functionality, and eventually I'd like to make this a web app with a front end and user ability to submit their own key
   words/hashtages and user accounts to follow.
